A Birthday
Christina Rossetti.

My Heart is like a singing bird
Whose nest is in a watered shoot;
My heart is like and apple-tree
Whose boughs are bent with thickset fruit;
My heart is like a rainbow shell
That paddles in a halcyon sea;
My heart is gladder than all these
Because the birthday of my life
Is come, my love is come to me...
